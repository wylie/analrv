**What is Anal RV?** It's a game to play while in the car. This site is a place to post the names and/or photos of the RV's you see.

**How Do You Play?** It's simple, as you drive around take the name of any RV's that you may see and add the word anal in front of it. Simple, right?

**Need an Example?** Okay, lets say you are see an RV whos name is the Expedition. Just take the name Expedition and add Anal in front of it. The new name for that RV is the Anal Expedition. Got it?
